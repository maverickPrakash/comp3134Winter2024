What is the definition of server port?

A server port is a communication endpoint in a computer network, 
specifically identified for a particular process or service running on a 
device. Ports are used to differentiate between different services and 
applications on a single device. They allow multiple services to operate 
simultaneously on a single host, each service being assigned a unique port 
number.

What is server port range? How many bits does number above represent?
The server port range refers to the range of port numbers available for 
use on a server. Ports are 16-bit unsigned integers, meaning they can 
range from 0 to 65535. The number of bits used to represent a port is 16.
